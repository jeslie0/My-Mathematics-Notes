\chapter{Field and Galois Theory}\label{cha:galois-theory}
This chapter is based on my first introduction to Galois Theory at The University of Edinburgh (which was based on \cite{Stewart:Galois_Theory}), my second course at the University of Western, based on notes taken by myself and  Mohabat Tarkeshian, as well as the book \cite{leinster2024galoistheory}.
