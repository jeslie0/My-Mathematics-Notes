\chapter{Algebraic Topology}\label{cha:algebraic-topology}
Algebraic topology is the study of associating algebraic invariants to topological spaces. The main sources for this section are \cite{Hatcher:Algebraic:Topology} for a classical approach to the subject, and \cite{May:A_Concise_Course_In_Algebraic_Topology} for a categorical approach.
