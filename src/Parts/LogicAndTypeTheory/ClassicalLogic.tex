\chapter{Classical Logic}
This chapter introduces the tools of model theory and proof theory. It brings them together to prove some of the famous meta-mathematical results of the 20th century, namely G\"odel's two incompleteness theorems. This chapter is mainly based off the text~\cite{vanDalen2012logic}.
